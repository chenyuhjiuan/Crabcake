<h1>Crabcake Recipe</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>1 lb. jumbo lump or backfin crab meat</p>
<p>2 slices bread or bread crumbs</p>
<p>1 tbsp. mayonnaise (light or regular)</p>
<p>1 tbsp. Dijon mustard</p>
<p>2 tsp. Old Bay seasoning</p>
<p>1 tbsp. snipped parsley</p>
<p>1 egg (or substitute for special diets)</p>
<p>tartar sauce or cocktail sauce</p>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
<p>Beat the egg in a bowl. Trim the crusts from the bread and break the slices into small pieces. Add these pieces to the egg.</br>
        Mix in the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, Chesapeake seasoning and parsley, and beat well.</p>
<P>Place the crabmeat in a bowl and pour the egg mixture over the top. Gently toss or fold the ingredients together, taking care</br>
not to break up the lumps of crabmeat.</p>
<P>Form the cakes by hand into patties about 3 inches around and 3/4-inch thick. Shape should be like a cookie, not like a meatball</br>
or golf ball. Place the cakes in the refrigerator for at least 45 minutes before cooking. This is very important so the cakes don't fall apart.</p>
<h2>Broil the Crab Cakes:</h2>
<p>Slip them under a preheated broiler until nicely browned, turning to cook evenly, about 4 to 5 minutes on each side.</p>
<h2>Or saute:</h2>
<p>Heat a small amount of butter or olive oil in a skillet and saute the cakes, turning several times, until golden brown or about 8 minutes total cooking time.</p>
<p>Serve at once with tartar sauce, mustard, or cocktail sauce on the side.</p>
